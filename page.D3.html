      If you are using fresh ube, peel, steam, and mash it until smooth. If using frozen grated ube or ube puree, thaw it first then In a large pan, combine the ube, coconut milk, evaporated milk, condensed milk, sugar, butter, and a pinch of salt. Mix well after it Cook over medium heat, stirring continuously to prevent sticking. Continue until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan (about 20-30 minutes).
