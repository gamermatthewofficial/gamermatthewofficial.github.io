Allow it to simmer until it turns golden brown (about 5-10 minutes) then Carefully pour the caramel into a llanera (flan mold) or a round baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside to cool. Now Prepare the Flan Mixture, In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs gently. Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.
