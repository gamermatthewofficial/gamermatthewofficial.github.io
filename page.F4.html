      First Prepare the pork belly, cut it into strips. 
In a pot, add the pork and enough water to cover it. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until tender after that Remove the pork from the water and let it cool. Pat it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. You can also air-dry it for a few hours or overnight for better results then In a deep pan or pot, heat cooking oil over medium-high heat. Carefully add the pork pieces in batches, frying until they turn golden brown and crispy (about 5-10 minutes) after that Remove the chicharon from the oil and let it drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
